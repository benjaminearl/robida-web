## Plan for Robida
6th â€“ 13th April

1. Map landscape/content
Walking and talking our way around the village. Recording and documenting as we go. Getting to know Robida, experiencing Topolo, outlining and structuring content. Simultaneously finding motifs, visual elements that could become part of the website

2. Navigation Tour/Pathways
Finding the links between different pieces. Giving meaning to those pieces and the pathways between them. Creating a (site)map from experience. Not a top down overview but an experiential one.

3. Rhythm Seasons/Maintenance
Deciding how to maintain the website. Finding rituals, rhythms and routines to tend to the website. Seasons, natural rhythms, schedules.
