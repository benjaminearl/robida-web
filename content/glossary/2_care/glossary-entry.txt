Text: “Care work becomes better when it is done again, creating the specificity of a relation through intensified involvement and knowledge. It requires attention and fine-tuning to the temporal rhythms of an “other” and to the specific relations that are being woven together.” → from *Matters of Care: Speculative Ethics in More Than Human Worlds* by María Puig de la Bellacasa
