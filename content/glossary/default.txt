## Boundaries
“What are the boundaries that we choose and do not choose? What are the distances we need and what are the walls that will isolate and destroy us? How can we discern the differences between generative boundaries and destructive borders? Are we ready to move towards nourishing forms of adaptation?”

→ from Alexis Pauline Gumbs, “Honor your boundaries” in Undrowned – Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Mammals, 2020.

## Calendar
Now, then, before—time is a dimension we live in and a system of reference upon which to act, remember action and imagine others. We keep track of time. The measurement indicates the duration and the when, the from-when-to-when. A clock tells the time. The same temporal succession of states is constantly repeated. The repetition is cyclical. Each period has the same time duration. We live in an environment characterised by natural changes (natural clock of the alternation of day and night, etc.) that we observed, understood and classified. In relation to these changes we organised our activities and deemed it necessary to find a structure with which to keep track of these natural shifts and our actions, and to combine them. A calendar could be defined as “a system by which time is divided into fixed periods, showing the beginning and end of a year” or as “table showing divisions of the year”. A calendar also has the quality of connecting different events and moments of a specific time frame to inform one another, to see, plan and prepare beforehand. The calendar could be a tool to bring the cycle together, to assemble the events and seasons of a year as a whole, to give insight, access and overview.
