Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>The Academy of Margins, a project started by Robida in 2022, is a learning platform that stimulates collaborative and discursive learning, based on intimacy and rootedness where the margins are not only the site but also the widely intended content of the Academy itself.\u00a0<\/p><p>The main objective of the project is to invite relevant contemporary thinkers to a place usually excluded from their maps\/travels\/conferences and to stimulate the relationship with a younger generation of artists, curators, thinkers and public. The Academy of Margins stimulates the encounter between central theories and marginal places and the relationship between relevant authors and a younger generation that usually reads them and is developing itself through their ideas.<\/p><p><br>It is imagined as a spring program of lectures in Izba and a summer school (not yet confirmed).<\/p>"},"id":"2490654a-3565-48bf-9e8d-af8c4ac30f2e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
