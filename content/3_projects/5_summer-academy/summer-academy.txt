Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>The term residency, and especially artist residency, is many times the carrier of a concept that we do not find appropriate for the type of involvement we wish to generate in our place. We do not see the residency as a place where the artist\/researcher\/architect\/etc. would withdraw, a creative retreat where the person is isolated and self-focused. \nAnyway we don\u2019t want to find another word but to re-claim the word residency which we found interesting as it is a chronotope (using Michail Bakhtin word, coined in 1973) \u2013 it contains a spatial dimension (meaning the concrete place where the person is hosted) and at the same time a temporal dimension (recalling a defined period of time in which the person is hosted). Other words do not have this quality, some (as guesthouse) refer much more to a specific space, others (as soujour) refer to a period of time. Residency is here intended as a permeable space \u2013 that reacts, reflects and cares for what it has around it \u2013 and as an expandable time \u2013 guests can prolong their stay, return and start to build, through time, a relation with the place. \n\nRobida hosts residencies since 2019. The following artists, performers, architects, authors etc. temporarily lived in Topolove with us: Laura Savina, Ur\u0161ka Ali\u010d, Pearl River Sound, Katarina Gomboc \u010ceh, Marta Olivieri, Vera Borghini, Loredana Canditone, Kim Lang, Ola Korbanska, Jack Bardwell, Francesca Lucchitta.<\/p>"},"id":"50511a99-b137-4b26-a874-4068ebce5232","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
