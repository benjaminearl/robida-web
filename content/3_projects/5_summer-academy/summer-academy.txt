Title: Summer Academy

----

Text: APPLY! The Academy of Margins „Ä∞Ô∏è summer school will happen in one month.

24-31 August, Topol√≤ (IT)üåÄA week of lectures, workshops, explorations of the landscape around Topolove, readings, walks, conviviality.
It will be an event open to everyone BUT if you want to stay the whole week you need to apply. This is important because the village is small and we cannot host for one week a too big amount of people (we simply do not have the infrastructure for big numbers).

To apply:
„Ä∞Ô∏è you send an email to robidamagazine@gmail.com (writing Academy summer school in the subject line of the email)
„Ä∞Ô∏è you send an IMAGE that makes you think of what you can encounter here, of what you desire to experience, of what you are curious to know and meet
„Ä∞Ô∏è you write a small TEXT (half a page, around 2000 characters) which contains something about you, a question you come with and something you want to share or give back!
(We need this just in case there are too many requests!).
Deadline: next Sunday, July 31st. ** we‚Äôll take only some days to go through the application and let you know asap

Some other small things:
„Ä∞Ô∏è The participation to the summer school is FREE but you will need to contribute for food ‚Üí we will buy food and cook together
„Ä∞Ô∏è Sleeping ‚Üí we‚Äôll organise with tents and renting houses!
„Ä∞Ô∏è If you want to come not for the whole period but for some days, please write to us anyway! The priority will be given to those who want to stay the whole period but we are of course open to all different proposals!
„Ä∞Ô∏è You can of course participate to one or more events of the summer school without necessarily stay here: if you live nearby or if you want to rent a place in the area and participate to the activity it is of course possible :)
