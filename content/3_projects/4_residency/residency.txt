Title: Residency

----

Text:

The term residency, and especially artist residency, is many times the carrier of a concept that we do not find appropriate for the type of involvement we wish to generate in our place. We do not see the residency as a place where the artist/researcher/architect/etc. would withdraw, a creative retreat where the person is isolated and self-focused. Anyway we don't want to find another word but to re-claim the word residency which we found interesting as it is a chronotope (using Michail Bakhtin word, coined in 1973) it contains a spatial dimension (meaning the concrete place where the person is hosted) and at the same time a temporal dimension (recalling a defined period of time in which the person is hosted). Other words do not have this quality, some (as guesthouse) refer much more to a specific space, others (as soujour) refer to a period of time. Residency is here intended as a permeable space, that reacts, reflects and cares for what it has around it, and as an expandable time, guests can prolong their stay, return and start to build, through time, a relation with the place.

Robida hosts residencies since 2019. The following artists, performers, architects, authors etc. temporarily lived in Topolove with us: Laura Savina, Urka Alid, Pearl River Sound, Katarina Gomboc ceh, Marta Olivieri, Vera Borghini, Loredana Canditone, Kim Lang, Ola Korbanska, Jack Bardwell, Francesca Lucchitta.
