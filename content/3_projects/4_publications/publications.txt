Naselili smo se v tkanine / Ci siamo insediati nei tessuti by Katarina Gomboc Čeh
A book of poems by Katarina Gomboc Čeh, born out of a residency of Katarina in Topolove. It contains all the texts (new and old poems + some texts in prose) in Slovene and Italian. Beside being our first book of poems it is also an experiment of translation: the poems were in fact translated by different girls from our valley who speak Slovene but do not translate professionally. It contains illustrations by Elena.
Languages: Slovene and Italian.

Sentieri persi, perse parole / Zapuščene poti in besede by Janja Šušnjar & Laura Savina
This is a small guide through the paths around Topolove, explored and mapped by Janja and Laura during a residency. It connects the forgotten paths to the forgotten words of the Slovene dialect spoken in Topolò and connected to landscape. The book, beyond being a normal guide, suggests different little exercises and tasks to create memories connected with the paths explored. 
Languages: Slovene and Italian.
